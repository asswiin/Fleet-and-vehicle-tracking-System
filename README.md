Fleet & Vehicle Tracking System

The Fleet & Vehicle Tracking System is designed to improve the management and monitoring of
organizational fleets used across various sectors such as transportation, logistics, taxi services,
construction, and service-based industries. The system helps organizations track vehicles, manage
drivers, assign routes, and maintain vehicle-related information through a centralized digital
platform. By providing real-time visibility into fleet operations, the system supports better decision-
making, reduces operational delays, and enhances overall efficiency. It also assists drivers by
providing access to nearby service centers in case of vehicle issues, ensuring smooth and safe
operations.
